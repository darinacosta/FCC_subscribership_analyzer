The FCC only provides direct subscribership numbers at the state level. At the census tract level, they provide numeric categories that represent the percentage of households within the census tract that have a broadband connection. These categories break down as follows:

"0" - 0%; "1" - 0-20 %; "2" - 20-40 %; "3" - 40-60 %; "4" - 60-80 %; "5" - 80+ % 

The mean average categorical number among all census tracts in Orleans Parish is 2.97. Each category represents a given population per 1000 households, incremented by 200. The fractional of the average categorical number is treated as a fraction of 200.

 For example, in the case of the New Orleans city-wide average, the overall number is 200 + (.97 * 200), or 394 households per 1000 (39.4%). 

The mean average for New Orleans census tracts with a median average household income of less than $35,000 a year (American Community Survey 2005-2009 5 year estimates) is 2.43. The broadband subscribership of these tracts is interpreted as 200 + (.43 * 200), or 286, households per 1000 (28.6%).
